			  		words per line.
			  	</p>
			  	<p>
			  		Now is a good time to start a new paragraph to test things out. 
			  		I'm just wondering how this is going to work with the final 
			  		product. I have to think about the file system structure and
			  		all that. For example where is this text going to be stored. 
			  		It's probably best if the analysis happens on the client side
			  		since the client may have huge amounts of text.
